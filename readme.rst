This is my first project in Python.
It is a Game called Truco (Paulista). Very popular in Brazil.

<h2><strong> How to use: </strong> </h2>
You will need to install the package for the Deck of cards:

<strong>pip install pyCardDeck</strong>

Made and shared at Github by <a href="https://github.com/iScrE4m/pyCardDeck"> iScrE4m </a>

After that you can run the pre-loaded game (4 players):

python truco.py

Or just create a new one as shown at the very last lines of the truco.py file.
